     User gets detailed information such as description, YAML, tags and rating of resources.

  2. Filter by  categories :

     This allows user to filter resources based on categories which will help user to get multiple resources.

  3. Search resources on the basis of `name` or `displayName`

  4. Rating

     - User can rate a resource based on the experience
     - This can even help the other user as by knowing the rating they can directly compare and use the resource
